Setup Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (>= version 12.0)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Git (for cloning the repository)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Vinay-Samrat/Todo-List-test-cases.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Todo-List-test-cases
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the application on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if configured).

Running the Application
Once the development server is up and running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the Todo List app.

Running Test Cases
The project comes with a suite of test cases to ensure the app functions correctly under various scenarios. If you are new to running tests, follow the steps below:

Steps to Run Test Cases:
Make sure you are inside the project directory.

To run all the test cases, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will run the test cases defined in the tests directory using the testing framework configured in the project (such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine).

If you want to run specific test files, you can pass the path to the test file:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- <path to test file>
Example:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- src/tests/TodoApp.test.js
Running Tests in Watch Mode
You can run tests in "watch" mode so they automatically rerun when you make changes to your test files:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- --watch
Checking Test Coverage
To get a report on the test coverage, you can run:

bash
Copy code
npm run test:coverage
This will show you a detailed report of how much of the code is covered by the test cases.

Debugging Test Cases
If you want to debug your test cases, make sure you've added debug statements, such as scree.debug(), to your code, and then run your test file:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- --watch
Whenever the test hits the scree.debug() statement, it will output information to help with debugging.
